"""Process markdown files with structured sections.

This module follows a Read -> Modify -> Write pattern for all file operations:
1. Read entire file and parse into EntityMarkdown schema
2. Modify the schema (add relation, update content, etc)
3. Write entire file atomically using temp file + swap

No in-place updates are performed. Each write reconstructs the entire file from the schema.
The file format has two distinct types of content:
1. User content - Free form text that is preserved exactly as written
2. Structured sections - Observations and Relations that are always formatted 
   in a standard way and can be overwritten since they're tracked in our schema
