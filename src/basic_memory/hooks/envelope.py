"""SPEC-55 producer envelope for harness lifecycle events.

Adapted from ``plugins/shared/harness_envelope.py`` on the #1064 salvage branch
(credit: sourrrish) — the contract shape and idempotency keying proven there
carry into core, extended with the 2026-07-15 revision fields: ``id`` (UUIDv7),
``actor``, ``caused_by``, and ``promotion_status``.

Envelopes are trace, not memory: they remain ``promotion_status: raw`` and are
archived locally rather than promoted into the graph. The idempotency key is
computed from metadata only, so redaction never changes identity.
