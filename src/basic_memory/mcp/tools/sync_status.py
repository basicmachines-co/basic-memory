```yaml
node:
  topic: sync_status - Operation Monitor
  goal: Track system synchronization state
  insight: Real-time visibility into background ops
  context:
    states: [idle, indexing, migrating, syncing, error]
    monitoring: Progress tracking with estimates
    use_case: Pre-operation checks, debugging

```baml

## Monitoring Patterns
```python
# Basic check
status = sync_status()
if status["state"] == "idle":
    print("System ready")

# Detailed monitoring
status = sync_status(verbose=True)
if status["state"] == "indexing":
    print(f"Progress: {status['progress']}%")
    print(f"Files: {status['files_processed']}/{status['files_total']}")
