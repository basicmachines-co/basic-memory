# Continuing conversation on: {{ topic }}

This is a memory retrieval session. 

Please use the available basic-memory tools to gather relevant context before responding. 
Start by executing one of the suggested commands below to retrieve content.

Here's what I found from previous conversations:

> **Knowledge Capture Recommendation:** As you continue this conversation, actively look for opportunities to record new information, decisions, or insights that emerge. Use `write_note()` to document important context.

{{#if has_results}}
{{#each results}}
    {{#each primary_results}}
        --- memory://{{ permalink }}
    
        ## {{ title }}
        - **Type**: {{ type }}
        - **Created**: {{date created_at "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"}}
        
        {{#if content}}
        **Excerpt**:
        {{ content }}
        {{/if}}

        You can read this document with: `read_note("{{ permalink }}")`
    {{/each}}

    {{#if (size related_results)}}
    ## Related Context
    {{#each related_results}}
        - type: **{{ type }}**
        - title: {{ title }}
        {{#if permalink}}
        You can view this document with: `read_note("{{ permalink }}")`
        {{else}}
        You can view this file with: `read_file("{{ file_path }}")`
        {{/if}}
    {{/each}}
    {{/if}}

The supplied query did not return any information specifically on this topic.

## Opportunity to Capture New Knowledge!

This is an excellent chance to start documenting this topic:

```python
await write_note(
    title="{{ topic }}",
    content=f'''
    # {{ topic }}

    ## Overview
    [Summary of what we know about {{ topic }}]

    ## Key Points
    [Main aspects or components of {{ topic }}]

    ## Observations
    - [category] [First important observation about {{ topic }}]
    - [category] [Second observation about {{ topic }}]

    ## Relations
    - relates_to [[Related Topic]]
    - part_of [[Broader Context]]
    '''
)
```

## Other Options

Please use the available basic-memory tools to gather relevant context before responding.
You can also:
- Try a different search term
- Check recent activity with `recent_activity(timeframe="1w")`


{{/if}}

## Next Steps

You can:
- Explore more with: `search_notes({"text": "{{ topic }}"})`
- See what's changed: `recent_activity(timeframe="{{default timeframe "7d"}}")`
- **Record new learnings or decisions from this conversation:** `write_note(title="[Create a meaningful title]", content="[Content with observations and relations]")`

## Knowledge Capture Recommendation

As you continue this conversation, **actively look for opportunities to:**
1. Record key information, decisions, or insights that emerge
2. Link new knowledge to existing topics 
3. Suggest capturing important context when appropriate
4. Create forward references to topics that might be created later

Remember that capturing knowledge during conversations is one of the most valuable aspects of Basic Memory.
