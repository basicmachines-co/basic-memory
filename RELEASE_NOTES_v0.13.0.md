## Breaking Changes & Migration

### For Existing Users

**Automatic Migration**: First run will automatically migrate existing data to the new unified database structure. No manual action required.

**What Changes:**
- Database location: Moved to `~/.basic-memory/memory.db` (unified across projects)
- API endpoints: Now require project context (e.g., `/main/entities` instead of `/entities`)
- Configuration: Projects defined in `config.json` are synced with database

**What Stays the Same:**
- All existing notes and data remain unchanged
- Default project behavior maintained for single-project users
- All existing MCP tools continue to work without modification

### For API Consumers

```python
# Old (v0.12.x)
response = client.get("/entities")

# New (v0.13.0)
response = client.get("/main/entities")  # 'main' is default project
```

### For Multi-Project Setup

```json
// config.json example
{
  "projects": {
    "main": "~/basic-memory",
    "work-notes": "~/work/notes",
    "personal": "~/personal/journal"
  },
  "default_project": "main",
  "sync_changes": true
}
```
