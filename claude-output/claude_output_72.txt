Great! The fix has been properly applied. Now let's summarize what we did.

---SUMMARY---
I fixed Issue #72 where notes with wikilinks stayed in "modified" status after syncing. The problem was that after processing relations in files with wikilinks, the final checksum wasn't being accurately computed and saved, causing false "modified" status on subsequent syncs.

Changes made:
1. Created a new test file (`tests/sync/test_sync_wikilink_issue.py`) that reproduces the issue with notes containing wikilinks staying in modified status.

2. Fixed the `sync_markdown_file` method in `src/basic_memory/sync/sync_service.py`:
   - Added computation of a final checksum after relation processing is complete
   - Updated the entity record with this final checksum
   - Enhanced logging to include the checksum in the completion message
   - Ensured the final checksum is returned from the method

The fix ensures that after relations between files are established and updated, the final file state is properly captured in the checksum, preventing false "modified" status in subsequent syncs. This issue was particularly noticeable when importing existing notes with wikilinks from other vaults, as mentioned in the bug report.
