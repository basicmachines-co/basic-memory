Issue #75: [BUG] Cursor has errors calling search tool

Issue Description:
## Bug Description



> Cursor cannot figure out how to structure the parameters for that tool call.  No matter what Cursor seems to try it gets the errors.
> 
> ```Looking at the error messages more carefully:
> - When I pass an object: "Parameter 'query' must be of type undefined, got object"
> - When I pass a string: "Parameter 'query' must be of type undefined, got string"
> 
> 
> 
>  and then it reports:  "Invalid type for parameter 'query' in tool search_notes"
> Any chance you can give me some guidance with this?
> 

## Steps To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
